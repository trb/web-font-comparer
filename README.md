# Compare fonts

So far, [Google Webfonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts) is supported. When
you've chosen all fonts for your collection, you get a link-tag, generated
by Google Webfonts.

Take that link and go to [the web font comparer](http://trb.github.com/web-font-comparer).

Click "Change fonts" in the top left corner, paste your link-tag and change
the family/weight for each section (fonts available in your collection will be listed on the page).
